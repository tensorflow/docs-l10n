__DO NOT EDIT__

## Notebook failures

The notebooks listed below did *not* run to completion. This usually indicates
that a translated file is out-of-date and not synced to its
[source counterpart](../en-snapshot/). Notebooks can be run in Colab and synced
using the [GitLocalize project](https://gitlocalize.com/tensorflow/docs-l10n).

*Notebooks are tested on a periodic basis (usually weekly or bi-weekly) so the
following list may not reflect recent updates.*
