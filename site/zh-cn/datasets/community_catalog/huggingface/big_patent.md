## all

使用以下命令在 TFDS 中加载此数据集：

```python
ds = tfds.load('huggingface:big_patent/all')
```

- **说明**：

```
BIGPATENT, consisting of 1.3 million records of U.S. patent documents
along with human written abstractive summaries.
Each US patent application is filed under a Cooperative Patent Classification
(CPC) code. There are nine such classification categories:
A (Human Necessities), B (Performing Operations; Transporting),
C (Chemistry; Metallurgy), D (Textiles; Paper), E (Fixed Constructions),
F (Mechanical Engineering; Lightning; Heating; Weapons; Blasting),
G (Physics), H (Electricity), and
Y (General tagging of new or cross-sectional technology)
There are two features:
  - description: detailed description of patent.
  - abstract: Patent abastract.
