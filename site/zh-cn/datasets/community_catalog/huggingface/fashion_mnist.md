## fashion_mnist

使用以下命令在 TFDS 中加载此数据集：

```python
ds = tfds.load('huggingface:fashion_mnist/fashion_mnist')
```

- **说明**：

```
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images—consisting of a training set of
60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image,
associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in
replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.
It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.
