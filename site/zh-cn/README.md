# 非官方翻译

我们的 TensorFlow 社区翻译了这些文档。因为社区翻译是尽力而为， 所以无法保证它们是最准确的，并且反映了最新的
[官方英文文档](https://tensorflow.google.cn/?hl=en)。如果您有改进此翻译的建议， 请提交 pull request 到
[tensorflow/docs](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs) GitHub 仓库。要志愿地撰写或者审核译文，请加入
[docs-zh-cn@tensorflow.org Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!forum/docs-zh-cn)。

## Community translations

Our TensorFlow community has translated these documents. Because community
translations are *best-effort*, there is no guarantee that this is an accurate
and up-to-date reflection of the
[official English documentation](https://tensorflow.google.cn/?hl=en).
If you have suggestions to improve this translation, please send a pull request 
to the [tensorflow/docs](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs) GitHub repository. 
To volunteer to write or review community translations, contact the
[docs@tensorflow.org list](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!forum/docs).

Note: Please focus translation efforts on
[TensorFlow 2](https://tensorflow.google.cn) in the
[site/en/](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/tree/master/site/en/)
directory. TF 1.x community docs will no longer be updated as we prepare for the
2.0 release. See
[the announcement](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/docs/vO0gQnEXcSM/YK_ybv7tBQAJ).

## Do not translate

The following sections are *not* included in `site/zh-cn` community translations
project. TensorFlow.org does not translate API reference, and uses an internal
system for landing pages and release-sensitive documentation. Please do not
translate the following sections:

* The `/install/` directory.
* API reference including `/api_docs/` and `/versions/` directories.
* Navigation: `_book.yaml` and `_toc.yaml` files.
* Overview pages such as `_index.yaml`, `index.html`, and `index.md`.

## Simplified Chinese translation guide

Some technical words in English do not have a natural translation. Do *not*
translate the following words:

*   (mini-) batch
*   estimator
*   eager execution
*   dense
