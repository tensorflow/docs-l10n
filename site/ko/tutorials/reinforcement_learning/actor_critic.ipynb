        "For instance, suppose that two actions for a given state would yield the same expected return. Without the critic, the algorithm would try to raise the probability of these actions based on the objective $J$. With the critic, it may turn out that there's no advantage ($G - V = 0$) and thus no benefit gained in increasing the actions' probabilities and the algorithm would set the gradients to zero.\n",
