        "MoViNets (Mobile Video Networks) provide a family of efficient video classification models, supporting inference on streaming video. In this tutorial, you will use a pre-trained MoViNet model to classify videos, specifically for an action recognition task, from the [UCF101 dataset](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php). A pre-trained model is a saved network that was previously trained on a larger dataset. You can find more details about MoViNets in the [MoViNets: Mobile Video Networks for Efficient Video Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11511) paper by Kondratyuk, D. et al. (2021).
