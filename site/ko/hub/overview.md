# TensorFlow 허브

TensorFlow Hub is an open repository and library for reusable machine learning. The [tfhub.dev](https://tfhub.dev) repository provides many pre-trained models: text embeddings, image classification models, TF.js/TFLite models and much more. The repository is open to [community contributors](https://tfhub.dev/s?subtype=publisher).

The [`tensorflow_hub`](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub) library lets you download and reuse them in your TensorFlow program with a minimum amount of code.

```python
import tensorflow_hub as hub

model = hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/google/nnlm-en-dim128/2")
embeddings = model(["The rain in Spain.", "falls",
                    "mainly", "In the plain!"])

print(embeddings.shape)  #(4,128)
```
