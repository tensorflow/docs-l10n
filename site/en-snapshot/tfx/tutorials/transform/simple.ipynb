Analyzers also accept and return tensors, but unlike TensorFlow ops they only run once, during training, and typically make a full pass over the entire training dataset. They create <a target='_blank' href='https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/constant'>tensor constants</a>, which are added to your graph. For example, `tft.min` computes the minimum of a tensor over the training dataset. tf.Transform provides a fixed set of analyzers, but this will be extended in future versions.\n",
