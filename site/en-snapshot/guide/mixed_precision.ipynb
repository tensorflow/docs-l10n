By keeping certain parts of the model in the 32-bit types for numeric stability, the model will have a lower step time and train equally as well in terms of the evaluation metrics such as accuracy. This guide describes how to use the experimental Keras mixed precision API to speed up your models. Using this API can improve performance by more than 3 times on modern GPUs and 60% on TPUs."

        "\n",
        "### Increasing your batch size\n",
        "If it doesn't affect model quality, try running with double the batch size when using mixed precision. As float16 tensors use half the memory, this often allows you to double your batch size without running out of memory. Increasing batch size typically increases training throughput, i.e. the training elements per second your model can run on.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Ensuring GPU Tensor Cores are used\n",
        "\n",
        "As mentioned previously, modern NVIDIA GPUs use a special hardware unit called Tensor Cores that can multiply float16 matrices very quickly. However, Tensor Cores requires certain dimensions of tensors to be a multiple of 8. In the examples below, an argument is bold if and only if it needs to be a multiple of 8 for Tensor Cores to be used.\n",

        "* tf.keras.layers.Dense(**units=64**)\n",
        "* tf.keras.layers.Conv2d(**filters=48**, kernel_size=7, stride=3)\n",

        "* tf.keras.layers.LSTM(**units=64**)\n",
        "  * And similar for other RNNs, such as tf.keras.layers.GRU\n",
        "* tf.keras.Model.fit(epochs=2, **batch_size=128**)\n",
        "\n",
        "You should try to use Tensor Cores when possible. If you want to learn more [NVIDIA deep learning performance guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/dl-performance-guide/index.html) describes the exact requirements for using Tensor Cores as well as other Tensor Core-related performance information.\n",

        "TPUs do not require any other mixed precision-specific tuning to get optimal performance. TPUs already require the use of XLA. They benefit from having certain dimensions being multiples of $128$, but this applies equally to float32 as it does for mixed precision. See the [Cloud TPU Performance Guide](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/performance-guide) for general TPU performance tips, which apply to mixed precision as well as float32."

        "* If you use a custom training loop with `mixed_float16`, in addition to the above lines, you need to wrap your optimizer with a `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`. Then call `optimizer.get_scaled_loss` to scale the loss, and `optimizer.get_unscaled_gradients` to unscale the gradients.\n",

Most official models, such as [ResNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/vision/image_classification) and [Transformer](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/official/nlp/transformer) will run using mixed precision by passing `--dtype=fp16`. \n"
