# Making predictions from 2d data

In this tutorial you will train a model to make predictions from numerical data describing a set of cars.

This exercise will demonstrate steps common to training many different kinds of models, but will use a small dataset and a simple (shallow) model. The primary aim is to help you get familiar with the basic terminology, concepts and syntax around training models with TensorFlow.js and provide a stepping stone for further exploration and learning.
