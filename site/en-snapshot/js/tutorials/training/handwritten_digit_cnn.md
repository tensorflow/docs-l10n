# Handwritten digit recognition with CNNs

In this tutorial, we'll build a TensorFlow.js model to recognize handwritten digits with a convolutional neural network. First, we'll train the classifier by having it “look” at thousands of handwritten digit images and their labels. Then we'll evaluate the classifier's accuracy using test data that the model has never seen.
