# Transfer learning audio recognizer

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a custom audio classifier that you will train in the browser using TensorFlow.js. You will use it to control a slider in the browser by making sounds.

You will use transfer learning to make a model that classifies short sounds with relatively little training data. You will be using a pre-trained model for [speech command recognition](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/speech-commands). You will train a new model on top of this model to recognize your own custom sound classes.

This tutorial is presented as a codelab. [Follow this link to open the codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflowjs-audio-codelab/index.html)
