# Contribute to the TensorFlow community

An open source project isn't just about the code, it's also about the community of users, developers, writers, researchers, and other contributors. You can help grow and support this community.

## Community support

Many people [ask questions about TensorFlow on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow). Answering those questions and pointing people to the relevant documentation is a great service to the community.

Some users also ask support questions as GitHub issues. We try to discourage this, as GitHub issues are not the best place to ask for technical support. However, if you notice these issues, you are encouraged to answer them and point people to the relevant documentation.

## Communication

The TensorFlow community has a number of formal and informal ways of keeping in touch.

### GitHub

The primary communication about work on TensorFlow happens in the [TensorFlow repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/tensorflow). This is the place to discuss bugs, new features, and in-progress work.

<!--
### Forums

### Mailing lists

Mailing lists are reserved for announcements and contributor conversation. They are not intended to provide technical support.

#### General TensorFlow lists

*   [developers@tensorflow.org](mailto:developers@tensorflow.org) — Discussion for developers who are contributing to TensorFlow.


#### Project-specific lists

*   [docs@tensorflow.org](mailto:docs@tensorflow.org) — If you are interested in contributing to the TensorFlow documentation, join this mailing list.

### Blog

We post regularly to the [TensorFlow Blog](http://blog.tensorflow.org/), with content sourced from both TensorFlow developers and the broader community. If you would like to submit an article for review, please contact the TensorFlow Developer Relations team.

### Social media

For news and updates from around the universe of TensorFlow projects, follow [@tensorflow](https://twitter.com/tensorflow) on Twitter. To watch TensorFlow-related content, check out our [YouTube](http://youtube.com/tensorflow/) channel.

### Development roadmap

The [Roadmap](https://www.tensorflow.org/community/roadmap) summarizes plans for upcoming additions to TensorFlow.

### User groups

TensorFlow has many communities all over the world! For a complete listing, please refer to the [Community](https://www.tensorflow.org/community/groups) section on the TensorFlow website.

### Special Interest Groups (SIGs)

To enable focused collaboration on particular areas of TensorFlow, we host Special Interest Groups (SIGs). SIGs do their work in public. If you want to join and contribute, review the work of the group, and get in touch with the relevant SIG leader. Membership policies vary on a per-SIG basis.


#### Current SIGs

As of January 2019, the current TF-SIGs are:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><a href="https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/forum/addons">SIG Addons</a>
   </td>
   <td>Maintains a repository of contributions that conform to well-established API patterns, but implement new functionality not available in core TensorFlow.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><a href="https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/forum/build">SIG Build</a>
   </td>
   <td>Focuses on issues surrounding building, packaging, and distribution of TensorFlow.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><a href="https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/forum/io">SIG IO</a>
   </td>
   <td>Works on support for file systems and formats other than those in core TensorFlow (such as Apache Ignite FS, or Apache Hadoop SequenceFile), as subclasses of tf.data.Dataset and TensorFlow filesystems.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><a href="https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/forum/networking">SIG Networking</a>
   </td>
   <td>Maintains network fabrics and protocols not available in core TensorFlow.
