IG aims to explain the relationship between a model's predictions in terms of its features. It has many use cases including understanding feature importances, identifying data skew, and debugging model performance.\n",

        "IG has become a popular interpretability technique due to its broad applicability to any differentiable model (e.g. images, text, structured data), ease of implementation, theoretical justifications, and computational efficiency relative to alternative approaches that allows it to scale to large networks and feature spaces such as images.\n",

        "In this tutorial, you will walk through an implementation of IG step-by-step to understand the pixel feature importances of an image classifier. As an example, consider this [image](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Francisco_fireboat_showing_off.jpg) of a fireboat spraying jets of water. You would classify this image as a fireboat and might highlight the pixels making up the boat and water cannons as being important to your decision. Your model will also classify this image as a fireboat later on in this tutorial; however, does it highlight the same pixels as important when explaining its decision?\n",

How will your model generalize to new fireboats? What about fireboats without water jets? Read on to learn more about how IG works and how to apply IG to your models to better understand the relationship between their predictions and underlying features.\n",

Intuitively, you can think of the baseline's explanatory role as representing the impact of the absence of each pixel on the \"Fireboat\" prediction to contrast with its impact of each pixel on the \"Fireboat\" prediction when present in the input image. As a result, the choice of the baseline plays a central role in interpreting and visualizing pixel feature importances. For additional discussion of baseline selection, see the resources in the \"Next steps\" section at the bottom of this tutorial. Here, you will use a black image whose pixel values are all zero.\n",

The path from the baseline image to the input is in pixel space. Since with IG you are integrating in a straight line (linear transformation) this ends up being roughly equivalent to the integral term of the derivative of the interpolated image function with respect to $\\alpha$ with enough steps. The integral sums each pixel's gradient times the change in the pixel along the path. It's simpler to implement this integration as uniform steps from one image to the other, substituting $x = (x0 + a(x1-x0))$. So the change of variables gives $dx = (x1-x0)da$. The $(x1-x0)$ term is constant and is factored out of the integral."
