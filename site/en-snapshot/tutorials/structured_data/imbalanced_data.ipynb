Classifiers often face challenges when trying to maximize both precision and recall, which is especially true when working with imbalanced datasets. It is important to consider the costs of different types of errors in the context of the problem you care about. In this example, a false negative (a fraudulent transaction is missed) may have a financial cost, while a false positive (a transaction is incorrectly flagged as fraudulent) may decrease user happiness."

You should always start with the data first and do your best to collect as many samples as possible and give substantial thought to what features may be relevant so the model can get the most out of your minority class. At some point your model may struggle to improve and yield the results you want, so it is important to keep in mind the context of your problem and the trade offs between different types of errors."
