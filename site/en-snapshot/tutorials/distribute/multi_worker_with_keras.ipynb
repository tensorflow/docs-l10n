In multi-worker training with `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`, there is usually one `worker` that takes on a little more responsibility like saving checkpoint and writing summary file for TensorBoard in addition to what a regular `worker` does. Such worker is referred to as the `chief` worker, and it is customary that the `worker` with `index` 0 is appointed as the chief `worker` (in fact this is how `tf.distribute.Strategy` is implemented). `task` on the other hand provides information of the current task. The first component `cluster` is the same for all workers, and the second component `task` is different on each worker and specifies the `type` and `index` of that worker. \n",

The temporary directories on the worker need to be unique to prevent errors resulting from multiple workers trying to write to the same location.
