In the `tf-nightly` version and from TensorFlow 2.10, the `BackupAndRestore` callback can back up the model and the training state at epoch or step boundaries. `BackupAndRestore` accepts an optional `save_freq` argument. `save_freq` accepts either `'epoch'` or an `int` value. If `save_freq` is set to `'epoch'` the model is backed up after every epoch.
