In multi-worker training with `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`, there is usually one `worker` that takes on a little more responsibility like saving checkpoint and writing summary file for TensorBoard in addition to what a regular `worker` does. Such worker is referred to as the 'chief' worker, and it is customary that the `worker` with `index` 0 is appointed as the chief `worker` (in fact this is how `tf.distribute.Strategy` is implemented). `task` on the other hand provides information of the current task. The first component `cluster` is the same for all workers, and the second component `task` is different on each worker and specifies the `type` and `index` of that worker. \n",

        "\n",
        "Note: Always pass in `steps_per_epoch` argument to `model.fit()` since `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` does not support last partial batch handling. When using `steps_per_epoch`, `model.fit()` does not create a new iterator from the input every epoch, but continues from wherever the last epoch ended. Hence, make sure to call `.repeat()` on the dataset so it has an adequate number of examples for N epochs. If your dataset is not a repeated dataset, the `steps_per_epoch` should be set based on the amount of training data on each worker so that all workers would perform the same number of steps of training or evaluation, which is required by allreduce. In particular, if the sharding is not balanced, `steps_per_epoch` should be set to the size of the smallest sharded devided by the per-worker batch size."

The best choice of collective implementation depends upon the number and kind of GPUs, and the network interconnect in the cluster.
