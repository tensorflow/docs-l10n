You can call the `iter` method on it to create a per-worker iterator.

Because of this, it is also recommended to repeat datasets, and schedule a finite number of steps instead of relying on receiving an `OutOfRangeError` from a dataset.\n",

So it is important to create the whole dataset inside the function passed to `ClusterCoordinator.create_per_worker_dataset`.
