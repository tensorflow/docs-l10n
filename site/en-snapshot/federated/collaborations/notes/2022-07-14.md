# Notes form the 7/14/2022 meeting of TFF collaborators

*   Participants: Krzysztof Ostrowski (Google), Boyi Chen (LinkedIn)

*   Boyi’s update on LinkedIn’s progress and plans.

    *   Onboarded to TFF and integrated into ML infra
    *   Doing offline experiments on use of TFF for enterprise solutions
    *   Three areas of interest
        *   Freerider attacks
            *   Someone wants to contribute zeros, reap benefits
            *   Two goals - detection, solutions
            *   Model poisoning a distinct goal, but seemingly related
        *   Bias with heavily skewed contributors
            *   Some contributors having much more data than others
            *   Goes both ways - heavy users over-influencing the model, but
                also lots of lightweight users dragging performance down
        *   Cross-silo FL for a mixture of data from LinkedIn and from outside
            *   Guarantees on data not mixing
        *   Simulations of on-device FL
            *   Simulation capability already exists - we’re talking about
                simulating the behaviors seen in a realistic prodution
                environment
            *   Vary distributions of things like device processing power to
                asses how it may impact training performance
    *   Currently not much progress running on Azure, so punt on this for now

*   Modes of contributing / working together:

    *   Algorithms and coimponents in TFF for detecting freeriders and
        mitigating that
        *   Design doc - loop in people from both ends to help improve
        *   LinkedIn could contribute code
        *   Tentatively LinkedIn to own or co-own a directory within TFF repo
            where this could go - tbd whether one or more of these and where
            they would go

*   TFF’s plans

    *   Empower partners to build platforms based on TFF
        *   Components
        *   References architectures
        *   Both cross-silo and cross-device
            *   Some code is already in OSS, more code upcoming
        *   End-to-end privacy, etc., guarantees for platform partners

*   Next steps:

    *   Create individual proposals to iterate on with people from both sides
    *   Prioritize together
        *   Maybe that means increasing frequence to once per 2 weeks
        *   Pick topics to unpack, loop in people interested in the topic
