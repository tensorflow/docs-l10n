        "When you're doing supervised learning, you can use `fit()` and everything works smoothly.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you need to write your own training loop from scratch, you can use the `GradientTape` and take control of every little detail.\n",
        "\n",
        "But what if you need a custom training algorithm, but you still want to benefit from the convenient features of `fit()`, such as callbacks, built-in distribution support, or step fusing?\n",
        "\n",
        "A core principle of Keras is **progressive disclosure of complexity**. You should always be able to get into lower-level workflows in a gradual way. You shouldn't fall off a cliff if the high-level functionality doesn't exactly match your use case. You should be able to gain more control over the small details while retaining a commensurate amount of high-level convenience.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you need to customize what `fit()` does, you should **override the training step function of the `Model` class**. This is the function that is called by `fit()` for every batch of data. You will then be able to call `fit()` as usual -- and it will be running your own learning algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that this pattern does not prevent you from building models with the Functional API. You can do this whether you're building `Sequential` models, Functional API models, or subclassed models.\n",
